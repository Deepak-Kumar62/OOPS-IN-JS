What is OOPS?
    OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It's a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

Four pillars of object oriented programming
    (1) Encapsulation
    (2) Abstraction
    (3) Inheritance
    (4) Polymorphism
